# CS2_IAI
All of my study material pertaining towards the CS2_IAI module (Aston University)

# Motive:

The motive behind this repository is to provide myself with a progamatical understanding of the Theory surrounding CS2_IAI - preparing myself in a way that I will understand

Fortunately, there won't be any Python on the exam which means:

A. I won't be tainting my mind by writing Python

B. By proxy of point A, I can write everything in God's ordained language (C)

# File Contents:

The areas of study included in this repoository are the general topics covered in each unit such as 

- PEAS
- Agents
- Problem Formulation
- Neural Networks
- Searching

these are the broader topics that are at play in this module, therefore each source file aims to be a reflection of such

# Building:

```
git clone this repo

since there are individual source files that do separate things, plus for the sake of wanting to be
able to test files out adjacent from one another, it's a simple case of doing the following

gcc --std=c99 src/filename.c
```
